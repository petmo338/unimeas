# Power related functions

def freq(sysclk, hclk, pclk1, pclk2):
	"""
	If given no arguments, returns a tuple of clock frequencies: (sysclk, hclk, pclk1, pclk2).
	These correspond to:

	sysclk: frequency of the CPU
	hclk: frequency of the AHB bus, core memory and DMA
	pclk1: frequency of the APB1 bus
	pclk2: frequency of the APB2 bus
	If given any arguments then the function sets the frequency of the CPU, and the busses if
	additional arguments
	are given. Frequencies are given in Hz. Eg freq(120000000) sets sysclk (the CPU frequency) to
	120MHz.
	Note that not all values are supported and the largest supported frequency not greater than the
	given value will
	be selected.
	Supported sysclk frequencies are (in MHz):
	8, 16, 24, 30, 32, 36, 40, 42, 48, 54, 56, 60, 64, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 144, 168.

	The maximum frequency of hclk is 168MHz, of pclk1 is 42MHz, and of pclk2 is 84MHz.
	Be sure not to set frequencies above these values.

	The hclk, pclk1 and pclk2 frequencies are derived from the sysclk frequency using a prescaler
	(divider).
	Supported prescalers for hclk are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 64, 128, 256, 512. Supported prescalers for
	pclk1 and pclk2 are:
	1, 2, 4, 8. A prescaler will be chosen to best match the requested frequency.

	A sysclk frequency of 8MHz uses the HSE (external crystal) directly and 16MHz uses the HSI
	(internal oscillator)
	directly. The higher frequencies use the HSE to drive the PLL (phase locked loop), and then use
	the output of the PLL.

	Note that if you change the frequency while the USB is enabled then the USB may become unreliable.
	It is best to
	change the frequency in boot.py, before the USB peripheral is started. Also note that sysclk
	frequencies below
	36MHz do not allow the USB to function correctly.
